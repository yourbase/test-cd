# This is YourBase's modified ci.sh that runs inside a CI container with access
# to a persistent caching volume.

# Test mode:
#
# $ ci.sh test
#
# You can run it in test mode to test changes that are in the git index (i.e:
# used "git add"). This allows you to test local changes before pushing the
# changes to a git branch.

# This script looks at the files changed in git against origin/master
# (actually a common ancestor of origin/master and the current commit) and
# queries for all build and test targets associated with those files.
#
# Running this script on a CI server should allow you to only test the targets
# that have changed since the last time your merged or fast forwarded.
#
# This script can be used to recreate the benefits that TAP provides to
# Google's developers as describe by Mike Bland on his article on Google's
# infrastructure.
# https://mike-bland.com/2012/10/01/tools.html#tools-tap-sponge
#
# "Every single change submitted to Googleâ€™s Perforce depot is built and
# tested, and only those targets affected by a particular change are
# built and tested"
#
# When this script is triggered by Gerrit's patchset-updated hook (for example)
# you can replace origin/master in the COMMIT_RANGE variable initialization
# with the branch passed as argument to the hook. When using Jenkins with the
# Gerrit Trigger Plugin, use $GERRIT_BRANCH instead. This would make it
# possible to have the Verified label on Gerrit patchsets populated as fast
# as possible.
# For a ref-updated event, use "${GERRIT_OLDREV}..${GERRIT_NEWREV}" as the
# value for COMMIT_RANGE.
# When running in Travis-CI, you can directly use the $TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE
# environment variable.


# For this to work on Travis, first we would need `git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/master`
# But like said above, we can just use $TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE
#COMMIT_RANGE=${COMMIT_RANGE:-$(git merge-base origin/master HEAD)".."}
